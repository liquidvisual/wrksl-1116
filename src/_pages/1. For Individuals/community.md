## Building healthy communities

Workskil Community teams take a caring approach to help connect people to the world around them.

We provide counselling and support to families and people from all walks of life.

Our dedicated health teams also focus on the strengths, recovery goals and aspirations of people with mental ill health.

We work to promote recovery and reduce the stigma surrounding mental ill health, and demonstrate to our clients that with the right support, everybody can lead a fulfilling and healthy life.
