## We help young people get ahead in life.

We offer a range of services that help young people to fulfill their potential by:

* linking them with learning opportunities such as work experience, internships and apprenticeships
* helping them search and apply for jobs, and supporting them as they settle into their new role
* offering help to relocate to areas with a more promising job market
* connecting them to their local communities
* supporting those who are disengaged with the traditional school environment

**We work with young people aged 14 upwards, and their families, to address any challenges they face. Contact us to find out how we can help you.**
