lead: Workskil Australia was established in South Australia in 1982, initially trading as Marion Community Youth Support Scheme. In late 1989, with the integration of labour market and training programs, the organisation was reincorporated as Workskil Inc. In 2011, the organisation was renamed Workskil Australia to reflect our ultimate goal of providing services nationally.

Since our humble beginnings, Workskil Australia has become a major provider of employment and community services, participating in many labour market initiatives. In March 1998, Workskil Australia commenced as a Job Network (now jobactive) provider. In the same year, Workskil Australia also commenced as a provider of the Job Pathways Program and in 1999 commenced Work for the Dole programs. In 2002 Workskil Australia also began providing programs as a Community Work Coordinator organisation, and as a provider of the Personal Support Program. In 2006 the Job Pathways Program was replaced by the new Youth Pathways contract, and Workskil Australia was successful in becoming a provider of this new service. In the same year, Workskil Australia commenced as a provider of the Job Placement, Employment and Training program. 2009 saw Workskil Australia expand its’ Job Services Australia offerings in both South Australia and Victoria.

Most importantly, our aim is the same as it has always been: we’re here to help, however we can.
