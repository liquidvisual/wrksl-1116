## Workskil Australia is a national not-for-profit organisation, with over 30 proud years of supporting Australians to achieve sustained economic and social self-reliance.

We do this by providing a range of employment, work experience, disability, youth, Indigenous and community services across New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria.

We work hard every day to:

* Provide quality employment and community services to people seeking work.
* Provide specialist employment and community services to young people, people with mental illness, people with a disability and Indigenous Australians.
* Meet the labour needs of business and industry through quality recruitment services; and
* Deliver quality work experience projects across to the community.
